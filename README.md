# Boggle-GUI-Java
Basic GUI version of Boggle, programmed in JAVA

  This application was a project for a Paradigms course in which we were to program
a Boggle application that would generate a random board and search the board for
possible words. The program would compare a text file called lexicon.txt and see 
if it could find a match. It would find a match to the first character of the word
and check its surronding pieces to find the second character in the word. It would 
continue scanning around itself until it found a match, the word was complete, or
it would terminate due to no matches. Once it found a match, the word would be added
to a array list of words found. After it ran, the program would output to the terminal 
window how many words it found along with the words printed. 

  This program expounded upon the previous one with implementing a basic GUI interface.
The random board that was generated was printed to a grid layout on the screen with 
the click of the Begin button. Once clicked, the button's text changes to Done. The
user is to find as many words as they can and enter it into the text field. When the
user enters new words into the textfield, it gets added to a array list. When the user
clicks the Done button, the computer's array list of words and the user's array list
of words are compared, the results are outputed to the four different fields. How
many words are correct, which means how many did the user get correct. The number of 
words found by the Computer and how many words not found by the computer (how many 
the user found). Then the elapsed time that the user took to find all of their words.

The program runs and works flawlessly with no output errors.
